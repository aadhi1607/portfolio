          <p>
            This project develops a smart greenhouse system using advanced technologies to optimize growing conditions of crops. The smart greenhouse
            features environmental sensors that continuously monitor temperature, light intensity, and soil moisture. These sensors provide real-time
            data to Arduino Due (controller), which automatically adjusts cooling, lighting, and irrigation systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            An automated irrigation system, guided by soil moisture data and weather forecasts, delivers precise water amounts, enhancing efficiency and
            preventing over- or under-watering. LED grow lights supplement natural light, ensuring optimal photosynthesis. Remote monitoring is achieved
            via integrating the Arduino Due with ESP8266 Node MCU which is connected to Wi-Fi at our home.
          </p>
          <p>
            It transmits sensor data such as temperature, soil moisture, and light intensity, which can be accessed via smartphone or a PC. This project
            demonstrates significant improvements in crop yield, quality, and resource efficiency, contributing to sustainable agriculture and food
            security, and providing a practical solution for modern farming.
